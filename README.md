# Sample Code of Writing An Interpreter in Go

This is the interpreter I implemented when reading Writing An Interpreter in
Go, with some modifications from the original version:

1. Use go.mod to manage the module and packages.
2. Add position info to tokens.

I read this book mainly for the purpose of rewriting
[Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer)'s formula engine.
