# Sample Code of Writing An Interpreter in Go

This is the interpreter I implemented when reading Writing An Interpreter in Go, with some
modifications from the original version:

1. Use go.mod to manage the module and packages.
2. Add position info to tokens.

I give this book a high rate because it really teaches you how to write an
interpreter from scratch and prepare you for more sophisticated programs, including esbuild.
